## What is this project

This project contains my experiments written in a hurry to understand better how computer graphics work on my computer graphics class. All the folders in this project are separated pens in that i wrote in codepen.io.

## Why the code is so bad

I just wrote the code to make it work, and the thing that made it even worst was the codepen editor, i simple could not organize it in files.. :/
Maybe some day i will rewrite everything in kotlin, ts or another more safe language.

## Here are the codepen links
